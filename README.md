# Titanic_RFC

This is the simple solution to the traditional Titanic dataset, i initially used Logistic regression which only fetched Kaggle score of 74% but post analyzing the data in depth tried my hand in RFC and ended up getting 76.31% score which is not great but a small improvement. 

The features that i dint use here is Name, Cabin, Ticket which will be used in my next submission.
